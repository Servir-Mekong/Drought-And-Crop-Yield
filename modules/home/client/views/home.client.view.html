        The historical flood analysis tool was build upon the Joint
        Research Centre (JRC) Global Surface Water dataset. The JRC dataset
        contains maps of the location and temporal distribution of surface
        water from 1984 to 2015 and provides statistics on the extent and
        change of those water surfaces. These data were generated using
        3,066,102 scenes from Landsat 5, 7 and 8 acquired between 16 March
        1984 and 10 October 2015. Each pixel was individually classified
        into water / non-water using an expert system and the results were
        collated into a monthly history for the entire time period The
        Monthly History collection holds the entire history of water
        detection on a month-by-month basis. The collection contains 380
        images, one for each month between March 1984 and October 2015. For
        more information see the associated journal article: High-resolution
        mapping of global surface water and its long-term changes (Nature,
        2016) and the online Data Users Guide.

        The historical flood analysis tool presents the occurance of
        surface water for the selected period. A 100% water occurance means
        that all datapoints in the collection are identified of water
        (permanent water), 50% implies a location that is inundated half of
        the time. Locations with a low surface water occurance have only
        been inundated for a short period in the whole period, likely caused
        by flood events.

        It is important to note that not all historical floods are
        recorded in the dataseries. Floods might have occured between two
        overpasses of the satellites or observations might have been
        compromised by atmospheric conditions.

        The tool helps to identify areas prone to flooding using the
        complete Landsat archive. Areas which have been flooded in the past
        are also prone to floods in the future.
