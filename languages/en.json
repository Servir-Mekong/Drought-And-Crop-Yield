    "APPLICATION_PURPOSE_DESCRIPTION_1": "improve the operational, technological, and institutional capabilities to prepare for and respond to droughts in the Lower Mekong region;",
    "APPLICATION_PURPOSE_DESCRIPTION_2": "support local decision-makers in drought monitoring, analysis, and forecasting;",
    "APPLICATION_PURPOSE_DESCRIPTION_3": "provide policy makers and growers with current and forecast drought indices to facilitate decision-making within the current growing season; and",

    "APPLICATION_USES": "Application Uses",
    "APPLICATION_USES_DESCRIPTION": "The system can be used to assist local governments and the agricultural sector with seasonal drought forecasting and in implementing short and long-term mitigation measures during and in advance of droughts. It can also be used to characterize droughts through accurate, reliable, and timely estimates of their severity and impacts. In addition, the system can inform assessments of the economic, social, and environmental impacts of drought on vulnerable people and water-related resource systems. And finally, it can help develop critical regional and local thresholds reflecting increasing levels of risk and vulnerability to drought, as agreed by stakeholders.",
